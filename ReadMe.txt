This code is part of an individual project for [내일배움캠프], implementing a calculator.

It supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and performs calculations regardless of whether the input is an integer or a floating-point number.

The code is structured by separating input handling and computation into different classes, while arithmetic operators are managed using an enum.

Additionally, a filtering feature has been implemented using lambda streams to filter out values greater than the user's input.

By utilizing generics, the program allows input without distinguishing between int and double types.
